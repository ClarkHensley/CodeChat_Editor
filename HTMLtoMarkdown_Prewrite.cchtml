<h3><strong>1. Feature to be Added</strong></h3>
<div>The feature we will be adding is the conversion from HTML to Markdown
    within the CodeChat Editor. This will be implemented to convert the HTML
    produced on save for files to be stored in Markdown within the source code.
    Converting the HTML to Markdown will make the source code easier for the
    user to read from within an IDE or anytime when viewing the source
    code.&nbsp;</div>
<h3><strong>2. Repositories the New Code will be Added to</strong></h3>
<p>The new code will first go through the forked&nbsp;<a
        href="https://github.com/ClarkHensley/CodeChat_Editor">CodeChat_Editor
    </a>repository with the owner ClarkHensley on Github. A pull request will
    be made to the original repository, also <a
        href="https://github.com/bjones1/CodeChat_Editor">CodeChat_Editor
    </a>with the owner bjones1. The code will then be merged into this main
    repository.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Libraries, languages, and interfaces our code must work with.</h3>
<p>The programming language we will be using to implement this new feature is
    Typescript. The markup languages we will have to work with while
    implementing this feature are HTML and Markdown. To convert the HTML to
    Markdown, the <a href="https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown">Turndown
    </a>library will be used. This code will be added within the save function
    for the CodeChat Editor so it will need to work with the methods
    surrounding that functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Series of steps to complete this feature</h3>
<p>Step 1: Add the Turndown library to the project. Do this by installing it
    with npm using the following command:</p>
<p><code> npm install turndown </code></p>
<p>This will add the library to the list of dependencies within the
    package.json file. Now on npm install or npm update, this package/library
    will be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Load the library into the <a
        href="client/src/CodeChatEditor.mts">CodeChatEditor.mts</a> with the <a
        href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html">require()</a>
    function. This imports the module into the file, and allows an instance of
    the class to be created. Once the class is instantiated, this variable can
    be used to use the Turndown library functions. The code to instantiate the
    module is shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><code> import TurndownService from "turndown";
    </code></p>
<p><code>const turndownService = new TurndownService();</code></p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Step 3: The turndownService variable can then be used to call the turndown()
    function. This function will convert the HTML provided argument and return
    a string of Markdown that is equivalent to it. This will be added to the
    save function with the CodeChatEditor.mts file to allow the saved file to
    be saved as Markdown. An example of the turndown() function being used is
    shown below.</p>
<p><code>&nbsp;var markdown = turndownService.turndown('&lt; h1&gt;Hello world!
        &lt; /h1&gt;') </code></p>
<p>Step 4: The Turndown plugin, <a
        href="https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown-plugin-gfm">turndown-plugin-gfm</a>,
    will then be installed to enable the HTML to Markdown conversions for
    tables, strikethrough, and task list items. The install command and code to
    add this plugin to the instantiated class are shown below.</p>
<pre>npm install turndown-plugin-gfm<br><br><br><span class="pl-k">var</span> <span class="pl-s1">gfm</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">turndownPluginGfm</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">gfm</span><br><span class="pl-s1">turndownService</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">use</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s1">gfm</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span></pre>
<p><span class="pl-kos"><br>Step 5: Once the files are converting the HTML that
        the CodeChat Editor produces, the next step is to begin properly
        testing/debugging the Turndown library's ability to convert to
        Markdown. For conversions that are not in the Turndown library, new
        rules can be added using Turndown's addRule()
        function.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<h3>5. Tests to show the feature works correctly.</h3>
<p>To show that this new feature works correctly, a file will be made with
    differing HTML styles. This will be to test each conversion from HTML to
    Markdown and ensure that no data will be lost. There are many different
    test cases defined within the <a href="Markdown_MD.js">Markdown_HTML.js</a>
    file.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Goals for the draft pull request and final pull request.</h3>
<h4>Draft Pull Request Goals</h4>
<p>For the draft pull request, our main goal is to have the Turndown library
    installed and making the initial HTML to Markdown conversion on save. We
    aim to begin looking into possible solutions for losing styling data to see
    what our options are at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Final Pull Request Goals</h4>
<p>Our goal for the final pull request is to have the HTML to Markdown
    conversion implemented with no styling data lost. We hope for this feature
    to be fully functional at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Clark Hensley ch3136</strong><br><strong>Project 2: Converting HTML
        to Markdown in CodeChat Editor<br>Prewriting:<br><br></strong>1. Our
    goal is to implement a feature into the CodeChat Editor that will
    automatically convert the html encoded text shown in the editor in the doc
    blocks to the more-readable Markdown text when the file is saved. This will
    greatly improve readability when a CodeChat file is opened in another
    editor. Previous work by other contributors has already enabled CodeChat to
    automatically read markdown text and render it as html in the editor.</p>
<p>2. Our code will be initially added to <a
        href="https://github.com/ClarkHensley/CodeChat_Editor">my fork of the
        CodeChat Editor repository</a> and eventually merged into <a
        href="https://github.com/bjones1/CodeChat_Editor">Dr. Jones' main
        repository.</a></p>
<p>3. Our work will be implementing the <a
        href="https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown">turndown library</a> in
    Javascript, implementing this in the CodeChat Editor's client-side (the
    client serializes the data and stores it to the user's hard drive, we'll be
    changing which data are serialized).</p>
<p>4. Our first step for implementing turndown was locating the location where
    the changes needed to be make (the editor_to_code_doc_blocks() method in
    the <a href="client/src/CodeChatEditor.mts">CodeChatEditor.mts</a> file</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our second step was adding basic turndown functionality
    to the section of the above method that parses each doc-block. This has
    already been implemented on this branch.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
    third step will be to manage turndown edge-cases. Per <a
        href="https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown/issues/180#issuecomment-294141031">this
        issue</a>, turndown does not, natively, support storing html attributes
    that Markdown cannot natively parse (namely 'style" and "class" attrs),
    which makes the current turndown implementation in CodeChat incomplete.
    Some steps we might take include writing a turndown filter as shown in the
    linked issue, or possibly converting "style" and "class" attrs into
    &lt;style&gt; or &lt;class&gt; tags.</p>
<p>5. The file <a href="Markdown_HTML.js">Markdown_HTML.js</a> is a file
    containing, to my knowledge, examples of all the html elements and styles
    that The CodeChat Editor supports. We can use copies of this file to see if
    all the correct formatting is preserved after the turndown library is used.
</p>
<p>6. Because we've already had a good bit of success in running the library on
    example documents, I believe we might already be prepared for a draft PR.
    However, a full draft PR would, hopefully, fully implement some method to
    preserve style tags. A final PR would, hopefully, pass all tests and be as
    efficient as possible in how we preserve formatting, perhaps by
    implementing a turndown filter, or by exploring other avenues.</p>

<h2> Final PR Results </h2>
<p> All of the standard HTML to Markdown conversions are working along with non-standard Markdown conversions tables, task lists, and strikethrough. The style attributes are not currently being saved so many styling features do not save. The tables have been added and fixed so that they can properly convert both ways, and a custom style class has been added so that a black border is added. On converting back to HTML, the width for the tables is lost and reset to auto. The emojis have been fixed so they can properly convert as well.Â </p>

<p>We were unable to figure out how to add custom rules into pulldown-cmark's library. We attempted to create custom events, but could not get the custom events to properly work. The custom rules could easily be added to the HTML to Markdown side, but not to the Markdown to HTML side.</p>
